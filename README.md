**Waste Classifier**
<p>
This project is built using convolutional neural networks and computer vision for recognizing images of waste and assigning broad model labels. We have trained our network model on standard and partially obscured images, falling uder five standard categories, i.e Trash, Glass, Paper, Metal & Plastic and were able to get significant accuracy levels ranging between 85-90%.
